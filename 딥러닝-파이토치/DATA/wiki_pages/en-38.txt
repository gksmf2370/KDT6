Iran–Israel proxy conflict
Hezbollah–Israel conflict
On 17 September 2024, thousands of handheld pagers used by Hezbollah, a Lebanese political party and militia, simultaneously exploded across Lebanon and Syria.[10][11][12] Israeli intelligence services had intercepted the deliveries of the pagers and had rigged them with explosive material.[13] At least 12 people were killed and over 2,750 wounded,[7][8] many of them Hezbollah members. Civilians were also killed and injured.[12][14][15] The incident was described as the organization's biggest security breach since the start of the conflict.[16][17]
The first wave occurred at around 15:30 EEST. A second wave of explosions the following day targeting ICOM[18] walkie-talkies occurred the next day, killing at least 25 people and injuring 708.[5][19] Other electronics such as fingerprint biometric devices were also reported to have exploded, but it is not yet confirmed if those devices caught fire from other explosions or detonated themselves.[20][21][22][23] A Reuters security source said that hand-held radios were bought by Hezbollah five months prior to the attack, approximately at the same time as the pagers.[24]
The blasts affected several areas in Lebanon including Beirut's Dahieh suburb, southern Lebanon, and in the Beqaa Valley on the border with Syria, which are considered to have a Hezbollah presence.[25][26][27] Additionally, explosions were reported in several locations in Syria.[28][29] It is not clear if only Hezbollah members were carrying the pagers.[30] Around 150 hospitals across Lebanon received victims of the attack, which saw chaotic scenes.[31][32] Among those killed were two Hezbollah operatives and two children.[16][33][34] Iran's ambassador in Lebanon was injured by an exploding pager.[35] International officials and law of war scholars questioned the legality of the pager attacks under the Protocol on Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices.[36][37][38]
In February 2024, the secretary-general of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, told the group's members to use pagers instead of cell phones, claiming that Israel had infiltrated their cell phone network.[39][40] Hezbollah then bought a new brand of pagers, Gold Apollo AR924 models imported from Taiwan.[14][41][42] Nasrallah, responding to the explosions, described them as an act of war[43] and arguably a declaration of war by Israel.[44] Hezbollah vowed to retaliate.[26] Following the explosions, Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant announced a "new phase" of the war against the Axis of Resistance, with a focus on the north of Israel (which borders Lebanon).[45]


Background
Main article: Israel–Hezbollah conflict (2023–present)
A day after Hamas launched its 7 October attacks on Israel, Hezbollah[46] joined the conflict in support of Hamas[47] by firing on Israeli towns like Safed and Nahariya,[46] and other Israeli positions.[48] Since then, Hezbollah and Israel have been involved in cross-border military exchanges that have displaced entire communities in Israel and Lebanon, with significant damage to buildings and land along the border. As of 26 August 2024, Israel has killed 566 people in Lebanon (including 133 civilians).[49] According to the United Nations, over 90,000 people in Lebanon have been forced to flee their homes, while in Israel 60,000 civilians have been evacuated.[50] Israel and Hezbollah have maintained their attacks at a level that causes significant harm without escalating into a full-scale war.[51] Hezbollah has said it will not stop attacking Israel until Israel ceases its attacks in Gaza,[52] where more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed.[53][54]
Earlier on 17 September 2024, just a few hours before the explosions, the Security Cabinet of Israel established a new war objective: the safe return of displaced residents to the north. This goal was added to the two existing objectives—dismantling Hamas and securing the release of hostages taken during the 7 October attacks.[55][56] Israel's domestic security agency, Shin Bet, announced it had thwarted a Hezbollah plot to assassinate a former senior defense official using an explosive device.[57][58]

Use of pagers
Some Hezbollah members had used pagers for years prior to the 7 October attacks, but more members began using them after the attacks, as Hezbollah secretary-general Hassan Nasrallah claimed  Israel had penetrated their cellphone network. In February 2024, he called on members to stop using smartphones, citing Israel's capability to infiltrate them.[39][40] After this statement, Hezbollah bought the pagers, which were a new brand and imported to Lebanon in the months prior to the explosion.[41][14] Additionally, it was reported that the devices were compromised in Iran before being sent to Lebanon.[59]
The exploding pagers were the AR924 model from the Taiwanese company Gold Apollo.[60][42] However, Gold Apollo founder Hsu Ching-Kuang said they were not assembled by his company.[61] Gold Apollo then said in a statement that they were manufactured and sold by BAC Consulting KFT, which is based in Budapest, Hungary.[62][63][64] BAC Consulting had the right to Gold Apollo's brand,[65] under a license that had been in place for three years.[66] Hsu also commented that BAC's payments had been "very strange", having been paid via the Middle East.[67] Taiwanese police opened an investigation into Gold Apollo's involvement.[68]
BAC's Chief Executive, Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono, acknowledged working with Gold Apollo, but stated "I don't make the pagers. I am just the intermediate."[69] Hungarian government spokesperson Zoltán Kovács said that BAC Consulting "is a trading intermediary, with no manufacturing or operational site in Hungary. It has one manager registered at its declared address, and the referenced devices have never been in Hungary."[70]
The New York Times reported that BAC was in fact an Israeli intelligence shell corporation, created alongside two other fake companies.[71]
Sky News reported a Lebanese security source which said that Hezbollah had ordered 5,000 devices.[72] Israeli agencies have previously carried out operations involving explosive communication devices, notably the assassination of Hamas operative Yahya Ayyash in 1996.[73]

Explosions
First wave
Security camera footage showing exploding pager in BeirutOn 17 September 2024 at around 15:30 EEST,[7] many communication pagers across Syria and Lebanon unexpectedly exploded in an apparent coordinated attack on Hezbollah members, many of whom were seriously wounded.[10][26][16] According to the Lebanese Health Ministry, most of the casualties presented at the hospitals were in civilian clothing, and their Hezbollah membership was unclear.[74]
An Associated Press report indicated that the devices were possibly rigged with explosives prior to arriving in Lebanon.[7] The New York Times also reported that Israeli intelligence services intercepted the deliveries and rigged the pagers with small amounts of explosives.[13] Reuters reported an anonymous Lebanese source as claiming the devices had a board inserted into them which could detonate up to three grams of explosive upon receiving a code.[75][76] Facial and eye injuries were the most common effect of the explosions and, according to Tracy Chamoun, the pagers emitted a sound to encourage users to pick the devices up and lift them to their heads.[77] Other reports say that the device vibrated and showed an error message on the screen, and only detonated when the user pressed a button to clear the error, increasing the chance that the operator of the device would be holding it.[7]
The explosions occurred in several areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence,[7] including its stronghold of Dahieh in Beirut; southern Lebanon; and the Beqaa Valley near the Syrian border,[26][16][27] where explosions were reported in the towns of Aali en Nahri and Riyaq.[27] In Syria, explosions of pagers were also reported in Damascus and its vicinity.[78][79] There were early reports that 19 Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) members had been killed in Syria,[29] but the IRGC later released a statement saying none of its members had been killed.[80] The blasts reportedly persisted for up to 30 minutes following the initial detonations, intensifying the resulting chaos.[25]
Witnesses reported seeing multiple individuals bleeding from their wounds in the aftermath of the blasts.[26] In one instance, an explosion occurred inside the trouser pockets of a man standing outside a shop.[81] Photos and videos circulating on social media and local media from Beirut's southern suburbs showed individuals lying on the ground with injuries on their hands or near their pockets.[82]
Around 150 hospitals received victims of the attack, which saw chaotic scenes.[32][31] Hospitals in southern Lebanon, the Beqaa Valley, and Beirut's southern suburbs were overwhelmed with patients, many suffering from injuries to the face, hands and stomach.[83][84] In response, the Ministry of Health advised individuals with pagers to dispose of them and instructed hospitals to remain on "high alert".[27] It also called on health workers to report to work and asked them not to use wireless devices.[7][14] The state-run National News Agency appealed for blood donations.[85] Ambulance crews were deployed from the northern cities of Tripoli and Al-Qalamoun to help in Beirut.[14]
The attack came just a day after the Biden administration's special envoy Amos Hochstein visited Israel and warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against provoking a major escalation in Lebanon.[86]

Second wave
About 24 hours after the initial explosions, a second wave of device explosions occurred in Lebanon. Hezbollah stated that handheld radios were involved.[87] The devices affected were reported as Icom IC-V82 VHF walkie-talkies, which are known to be used by Hezbollah militants.[88] However, the IC-V82 model was discontinued in 2014.[89] Icom had previously issued an advisory warning about counterfeit radios, including the IC-V82,[90] and said on 19 September that it was conducting an investigation.[91] A sales executive at the company's U.S. subsidiary said the transceivers involved appeared to be "knockoff" products.[92]
Explosions were reported in Beirut, the Bekaa Valley, and southern Lebanon.[93] The explosions also caused fires in at least two homes.[94] Other explosions occurred at a funeral held in Beirut for three Hezbollah members and a child, who had been killed by the initial explosions.[95] Smartphones, solar panels, radios, intercoms and car batteries were amongst other devices that reportedly also exploded on that day.[96][97] Lebanese Civil Defense said it responded to fires that erupted in 60 homes and shops, including a lithium battery store in Majdel Selm, as well as 15 cars and numerous motorcycles. These fires were triggered by the explosion of radios and two fingerprinting devices in various locations across Nabatieh Governorate.[98] One compromised device was discovered inside an ambulance outside the American University of Beirut Medical Center and neutralized in a controlled explosion by the Lebanese Army.[99]
In the aftermath of the second wave of explosions, a group of men attacked UNIFIL vehicles in Tyre, before Lebanese armed forces intervened.[100][101] Hezbollah supporters reportedly prevented journalists from filming.[102][103] The Lebanese Red Cross dispatched 30 ambulances to transport victims.[104]

Casualties
A car fire allegedly caused by an exploding pager
At least twelve people were killed in the first wave of attacks;[1] more than 2,750 were wounded.[7][8] Civilians were killed,[12][14][15] including the 9-year-old daughter of a Hezbollah member and an 11-year-old boy.[105][106] At least two health workers were also killed,[107] along with the son of Lebanese MP Ali Ammar, a member of Hezbollah; Prime Minister Najib Mikati visited southern Beirut to pay respects to him.[39] It is not clear if only Hezbollah members were carrying the pagers.[30] In the second wave on 18 September, at least 25 people were killed and 708 injured.[5][3][23]
Health Minister Firass Abiad [ar; de] said the vast majority of those being treated in emergency rooms were in civilian clothing and their Hezbollah affiliation was unclear.[74] He added the casualties included elderly people as well as young children. According to the Health Ministry, healthcare workers were also injured and it advised all healthcare workers to discard their pagers.[74][108]
Mojtaba Amani, Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, was wounded; according to The New York Times, quoting unnamed members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, he lost one eye and suffered severe injuries in the other.[109][110] Two staff of the Iranian embassy were also injured.[27] Al-Hadath reported that 19 IRGC members were killed and another 150 were injured in Deir ez-Zor, Syria, but the IRGC denied any casualties.[111]

International law
Josep Borrell, the European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, questioned the legality of the attacks due to their high collateral damage among civilians, including the deaths of children. Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon, also raised concerns that the attacks were illegal. Belgian deputy prime minister Petra De Sutter went further, calling it a "terror attack."[36]

Indiscriminate
United Nations experts said the attack was indiscriminate in nature. It argued that given thousands of devices exploded simultaneously, meant the attacker failed to verify that each target and distinguish between those who can be targeted and those who cannot.[112] Alonso Gurmendi-Dunkelberg, of the London School of Economics, also argued in order to meet the principle of distinction, Israel would have had to verify if each individual device was in the possession of a military target and not a civilian one. He opines, it is unlikely Israel did that given that thousands of devices were detonated simultaneously.[113]
Professor William Boothby wrote in Lieber Institute for Law & Warfare that the targets appeared to be persons to whom the pagers were issued and it was "probably reasonable" to assume pagers would be in possession of their users. He did caution that the attack would be illegal if it was known that the pagers were also issued to non-combatant members of Hezbollah, for example its diplomatic, political, or administrative staff.[37] Boothby wrote that additional concern was whether the incidental injury from these larger number of explosions was proportional to the military advantage expected.[37]
Brian Finucane of the Reiss Center on Law and Security questioned whether the explosions constituted an indiscriminate attack, which are either not directed at a specific military objective, or employ a method which cannot be directed at a military objective.[38] Professor Toby Walsh argued the attack was indiscriminate in nature, given that the pagers can't be tracked.[114]

Booby traps
Booby traps are mostly outlawed under the Protocol on Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices ("Amended Protocol II") of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons,[36] to which Israel is a party.[37] Article 7, paragraph 2 of Amended Protocol II prohibits the use of "booby-traps or other devices in the form of apparently harmless portable objects which are specifically designed and constructed to contain explosive material."[36][37][115] The rules of engagement of some countries, such as the United Kingdom, also ban explosive devices disguised as harmless items.[36][116] The United States Department of Defense Law of War Manual gives watches, cameras, tobacco pipes, and headphones as examples of such items,[37] which are prohibited to "prevent the production of large quantities of dangerous objects that can be scattered around and are likely to be attractive to civilians, especially children".[36][117]
Law of war professor William H. Boothby wrote in the Lieber Institute for Law & Warfare's Articles of War that "The information in the early reports suggests that once the arming signal has been sent, the devices used against Hezbollah in Lebanon fall within Article 7(2) and are therefore prohibited on that basis ... it would appear, considering what is currently known and assumed, to be an unlawful weapon."[37]
Brian Finucane also questioned whether the pagers constituted prohibited booby traps under Amended Protocol II.[38]

Reactions
Lebanon
A senior Lebanese security source told Al-Hadath that Israel had infiltrated the communication systems of individual devices, leading to their detonation.[25] The office of Prime Minister Mikati said the incident was a criminal "violation of Lebanese sovereignty" by Israel.[39] The Lebanese government contacted the United Nations and certain countries, asking them to hold Israel responsible for the attack.[14] Lebanon's health minister, Firas Abiad [ar; de], praised the Lebanese health system's response, characterizing the response as "good" and noting that the system was able to "get care to those who needed it, especially for those with serious injuries".[118]
Lebanese journalist Mohammad Barakat, known for his anti-Hezbollah views, called the pager attacks a "Lebanese 9/11".[119] The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar reported that "the enemy succeeded in directing its harshest blows to the body of the Islamic Resistance since the beginning of the conflict with the enemy, in an exceptional security operation in terms of the ability to reach targets and means."[120]

Hezbollah
Hezbollah blamed Israel for the explosions, which it described as "criminal aggression" and pledged a "just retribution".[83] Those close to the group describe a state of shock following the explosions.[73] In his address on 19 September, Hassan Nasrallah called the attack a “severe blow”, adding that Israel had crossed a “red line”.[121] Nasrallah claimed that there were 4,000 pager holders and all of them were Hezbollah members but criticized Israel for being indifferent towards Hezbollah members being in civilian areas when they exploded, describing the explosions as a massacre. He challenged the IDF to invade Lebanon claiming Hezbollah was ready and claimed that Israelis displaced in the north would only be allowed to return if Israel ceased the invasion of Gaza.[122]

Israel
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) initially declined to comment when approached by the Associated Press.[7] Israeli Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi held a meeting with Israeli generals to discuss "preparation for defensive and offensive operations on all fronts".[39] The next day, Halevi made the following statement: "We have many capabilities that we have not yet activated... we have seen some of these things, it seems to me that we are well prepared and we are preparing these plans going forward." He also said that Israel will move further in stages, with each stage more painful for Hezbollah, and stated that the IDF is determined to allow displaced citizens in northern Israel to safely return to their homes.[123]
According to Axios, Israeli officials said they are aware that a major escalation on the northern border is possible after the explosions and said that the IDF was on high alert for a possible retaliatory response by Hezbollah.[86] The Israeli news website Walla, citing unnamed Israeli officials, reported that "Israeli intelligence services assessed before the operation that Hezbollah might respond with a significant counterattack against Israel."[124]
Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announced the beginning of a "new phase", and that the IDF is redirecting forces and resources to the North to confront Hezbollah.[125]
On the day of the first wave of attacks, Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid was in the on a trip to the United States talking to US government officials about a "ceasefire-for-hostages deal between Israel and Hamas". He cut his trip short and returned to Israel in response to the attack.[14]

Multi-national organizations
Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, condemned the attack, saying "civilians are not a target and must be protected at all times".[126]
Stéphane Dujarric, the Secretary-General's spokesperson, said the organization deplored the civilian casualties and warned of the risks of escalation in the region.[127][128] Speaking on 18 September, Secretary-General António Guterres stressed that "civilian objects" should not be weaponized.[129] The Security Council has scheduled a meeting for 20 September to address the situation.[23] Volker Türk, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, issued a statement saying that "Simultaneous targeting of thousands of individuals, whether civilians or members of armed groups, without knowledge as to who was in possession of the targeted devices, their location and their surroundings at the time of the attack, violates international human rights law and, to the extent applicable, international humanitarian law."[130]
European Union foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell condemned the attack.[131]

Non-governmental organizations
Pro-Iranian Kata'ib Hezbollah and Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba in Iraq offered medical and military assistance to Hezbollah.[132][133]
The Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention condemned the incident as "terrorist attacks against Lebanese people".[134]

Governments
Middle East
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, during a meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, reaffirmed Lebanon's security, stability, and sovereignty and said that his government rejects any "attempts to escalate the conflict and expand its scope regionally", calling on all parties to act responsibly.[135]
The Palestinian organization Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, blamed Israel for the pager explosions, which it called a "crime that defies all laws". In a statement, Hamas praised Hezbollah's "efforts and sacrifices" and said "this terrorist act is part of the Zionist enemy's larger aggression on the region".[136] The Palestinian Authority denounced the attack, fearing an escalation in Lebanon.[137]
The spokesperson of the Houthis, who govern much of Yemen, Mohammed Abdelsalam, called the attacks "a heinous crime and a violation of Lebanese sovereignty" and assured that "Lebanon is capable of facing all challenges, and has a resistance movement capable of deterring the Zionist enemy entity and making it pay a heavy price for any escalation it may undertake against Lebanon."[136] Hours after the explosions and two days after firing a supersonic ballistic missile at Tel Aviv, the deputy head of the Houthis' media authority, Nasr Al-Din Amer, said that the group is ready to support Hezbollah and send thousands of fighters to Lebanon should a war break out with Israel.[138]
Iran referred to the attacks as "Israeli terrorism" and pledged to provide medical assistance to those affected.[14] Foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani called the attack as an "example of mass murder" by the "Zionist regime".[139] Iran dispatched a medical team of twelve doctors, twelve nurses and the president of the Iranian Red Crescent to Lebanon to provide medical assistance. Iraq also dispatched a military aircraft carrying medical aid which landed at Beirut.[3] Jordan, Turkey, Syria and Egypt also offered medical assistance.[14][140]
The Iraqi government provided medical supplies to Lebanese hospitals following the first wave of attacks. The government also said that it will strengthen controls at its borders to avoid any "infiltration" or security risk with the imports of electronic equipment.[98]
Syria expressed solidarity with the Lebanese people and said it "stands by their side in their right to defend themselves" while condemning the blasts. The Syrian foreign ministry issued a statement carried by state news agency SANA accusing Israel of "its desire to expand the scope of the war and its thirst to shed more blood". It called on nations to "unequivocally condemn this aggression".[136]
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan criticized Israel during a phone call with Lebanese Prime Minister Mikati, saying that its attempts to spread conflicts in the region are "extremely dangerous" and that Turkey's efforts to stop "Israeli aggression" will continue.[141]
Outside the Middle East
The deputy prime minister of Belgium, Petra De Sutter, condemned the "massive terror attack in Lebanon and Syria".[142]
Ireland's Foreign Minister Micheál Martin condemned the attack, saying it endangered the lives of civilians and violated the Geneva Convention on indiscriminate attacks. Prime Minister Simon Harris criticized the attack and called for de-escalation.[143]
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova condemned the attack, adding that it requires investigation and international attention.[144][145]
United States State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller denied involvement in the mass explosions and said that it was not aware of the attacks in advance. The United States also urged Iran to refrain from retaliating for the mass explosions.[146] White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stressed the need for a diplomatic solution between Israel and Hezbollah.[136]
South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lee Jae-woong said the government is closely monitoring the situation in the Middle East with grave concerns and has continued to urge the relevant parties to seek a peaceful solution through dialogue.[147]
Impact
Lebanon
The Guardian quoted Lebanese health minister Firas Abiad [ar; de]'s assessment that the scale of the attack was greater than the 2020 Beirut explosion.[148] The head of Lebanon's disaster response committee also compared the pager attack with the Beirut explosion, in terms of the sudden influx of casualties and the strain imposed on Lebanon's emergency response system.[149] Many Lebanese doctors who were treating the injured concurred that the level of injuries was greater than that they treated after the port explosion.[150]
Schools were closed in Lebanon on 18 September.[14]
On 19 September, the Lebanese Civil Aviation Authority imposed an indefinite ban on carrying pagers and walkie-talkies inside checked luggage and carry-on items on flights at  Beirut–Rafic Hariri International Airport.[151] Air France and Lufthansa suspended flights to Beirut (along with Tel Aviv and Tehran), citing the security situation caused by the attacks.[14][152]
The Lebanese army announced it was conducting controlled blasts in various areas to destroy any suspicious pagers or remote devices.[153]

Hezbollah
CNN suggested that the operation was likely intended to instill paranoia among Hezbollah members, undermine their recruitment efforts, and weaken confidence in Hezbollah's leadership and its ability to protect its operations and personnel.[154] John Miller, CNN's Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst, stated the message for Hezbollah was: "We can reach you anywhere, anytime, at the day and moment of our choosing and we can do it at the press of a button."[154]
The Economist suggested several interpretations of the attack. One theory is that the pager-bombs were a precursor to a larger Israeli offensive aimed at disrupting Hezbollah's command and communications in preparation for a potential invasion. Alternatively, the attack might be the full extent of Israel's operation, delivering a significant impact beyond previous retaliatory measures. Lina Khatib of Chatham House suggests the breach could paralyze Hezbollah's military and instill fear, making the group more cautious with its communications. Another theory is that Israel acted preemptively to prevent Hezbollah from discovering the vulnerability.[73]
Lebanese journalist Kim Ghattas, who also contributes to The Atlantic, spoke to CNN, suggesting that the incident could be an effort "to cow Hezbollah into submission, and make clear that an increase of their attacks against Israel will be met with even further violence." She noted that it might act as a precursor to a large-scale Israeli campaign, especially as Hezbollah contends with the chaos from this "science-fiction-like attack" on its operatives.[154]
Political scientist Eliot A. Cohen wrote in The Atlantic that the explosions represented "a strategic win for Israel" beyond the death and injuries sustained by Hezbollah. According to Cohen, Hezbollah would not be able to trust electronic forms of communication, and an organization cannot function without them. He also opined that the explosions serve as a "morale boost" for Israel, after the killings of Hersh Goldberg-Polin and five other hostages three weeks prior.[155]
