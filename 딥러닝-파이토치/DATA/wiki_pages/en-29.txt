Federico Augusto Vigevani de Arce (born 1994 or 1995), also known mononymously as Fede, is an Uruguayan YouTuber and musician based in Mexico City.[1] As of September 2024[update], he is the most-subscribed YouTuber who speaks Spanish as a first language, and has the 49th biggest YouTube channel in the world with over 56 million subscribers.
From 2014 to 2018, he was a member of the YouTube group Dosogas.


Life and career[edit]
Beginnings and Dosogas[edit]

Vigevani was born in Montevideo[2] and studied graphic design.[5] Vigevani uploaded his first video titled "La Mejor Joda Por Celular! (Excelente)" in June 2009 at the age of 14.[5] He started regularly uploading in 2014 and uploaded his first viral video in which he used his mother's red nail polish to create art soon after.[5]
Vigevani and his friend Mathías Sellanes created the YouTube group "Dosogas" which featured joke and hidden camera videos.[6] The name is a portmanteau of "dos sogas", Spanish for "two ropes".[7] Their first video uploaded in June 2014 went viral and surpassed 100,000 views in a few weeks.[6] They would later create the Dosogas Team which included Agustina Añon, Nicole García, Christian Acosta, Sarah Silva, Sebastián Urdiales, Alejandra García and Oscar del Rey.[6] The group reached 100,000 subscribers in July 2016 and the following year would see them upload more vlog-based content.[6]
The group disbanded in October 2018 due to differences between members with multiple creators accusing Sellanes of being a "bad person".[8][9] Former Dosogas Team member Agustina Añon, reflecting on the success of the group in an October 2021 interview stated that they were "like a family" as they lived together and did "tours, music and daily videos 24/7".[10] Añon, who is also the girlfriend of Sellanes, stated that he and Vigevani had not spoken to each other for a long time.[10] Despite the channel being inactive, it remains the fourth most-subscribed channel in Uruguay with over five million subscribers as of September 2024.[11]

Solo and music career[edit]
In 2018, he released his first solo single "Te Encontré", which was described by Ana Laura García of Ovaciones as  merging "pop and urban rhythms".[12] In 2019, Vigevani and former Dosogas Team member Nicole García released the songs: "Te Quiero" and "Roast Yourself" together as "Fedecole".[13] 
In March 2020, he created the "La Vecibanda", Spanish for the neighbours, which were a group of children whom he would make entertainment and music videos with such as "Hermanos De Verdad", "Ya No Tengo Novia" and "No Somos Lobos".[14] The latter, described as his favourite song, surpassed fifty million views in less than a year after it was uploaded.[5] After reaching ten million subscribers in 2021, he created a new version of his song "Más Que Un Fan", in which he visited his  fan's homes.[14] He has performed his songs at venues such as the Luna Park in Argentina, the Pepsi Center stadium in Mexico and the Teatro Caupolicán in Chile.[14]
Vigevani was one of the hosts of the 2021 Kids' Choice Awards Mexico, alongside the music duo Skabeche.[15] In 2023, his show "El mundo de Fede Vigevani" made its debut at the Summer Theater in Montevideo before being performed eight times at the Teatro Gran Rex in Buenos Aires.[16][2] Additionally, he uploaded a viral video that year in which he bought three clowns on the deep web.[16] On 20 May 2024, Vigevani announced that he had become the most-subscribed Spanish-speaking YouTuber in a live-stream in which he jokingly stated that he wished to overtake El Reino Infantil, the Spanish-speaking channel with the most subscribers.[2][16] He competed in MrBeast's video "50 YouTubers Fight for $1,000,000" in which he was eliminated after failing to cut an umbrella-shaped dalgona.[17]
