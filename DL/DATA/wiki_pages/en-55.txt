Caterina Valente (14 January 1931 – 9 September 2024) was an Italian-French-German multilingual singer, guitarist, dancer, actress in film and television and entertainer. She spoke six languages and sang in 13. While she was best known as a performer in Europe, Valente spent part of her career in the United States, where she performed alongside Bing Crosby, Dean Martin, Perry Como, and Ella Fitzgerald, among others. She is regarded as one of the few world stars from a German-speaking country.[1]


Life and career[edit]
Caterina Valente was born in Paris on 14 April 1931[2][3] to Italian parents Giuseppe and Maria Valente.[4] Her parents were musicians from a family that had been in show business for seven generations. Her mother was a varieté [de] artist and a mime.[5] The girl's first love was jazz; she heard at home Duke Ellington, Sidney Bechet, Louis Armstrong and Bessie Smith. When she listened to Billie Holiday first, at about age five, she cried and knew that she wanted to become a singer.[5] She was trained in ballet early.[2] She toured with her parents in the 1930s, sometimes appearing on stage;[6] her career began in 1936 at the Friedrichsbau varieté theatre in Stuttgart.[7] She appeared as guitarist in a family sextet with her parents and three siblings.[2]
When World War II began, the family toured in Switzerland and could not return to Paris. They accepted an engagement in Germany to survive. They had to help with troop support. At age 13 she experienced the bombing of Breslau, helped to rescue victims and care for them; she later described it as hell: trying to rescue a person and finding severed body parts. They returned to France after stays in several Russian camps.[5] She worked there as a freelance singer in clubs, performing chansons, some composed by Gilbert Becaud for her.[2]
Grock, the clown who ran the circus in which her husband worked, encouraged her to appear with a singing number. A first record was produced by Walo Linder [de] of Radio Zürich and distributed to other stations.[5]
In 1953, she auditioned with Kurt Edelhagen, band leader at the broadcaster Süddeutscher Rundfunk in Germany at the time, for one hour in several languages. He said that she was the most musical woman he had ever heard.[7] Edelhagen, composer Heinz Gietz [de] and texter and producer Kurt Feltz organized her first recording on 29 March 1954, a jazz number "Istanbul". It was a flop, and Feltz convinced her that Schlager was more popular. "O Mama, O Mama, O Mamajo" became an immediate success.[7] In 1954, she visited New York City for the first time, where she watched Cole Porter's musical Can Can. She called Feltz immediately, requesting a German version of "I Love Paris" because she felt that it was "her song".[7] As "Ganz Paris träumt von der Liebe", it became a hit and her break-through;[2][6] selling 500,000 copies in 1955,[7] and more than 900,000 to December 1958, according to Der Spiegel's report of January 1959.[8] She produced "Malaguena" with conductor Werner Müller in Berlin, which became successful in the United States and led to her first foreign television appearance.[7]
In 1955, she was featured on The Colgate Comedy Hour with Gordon MacRae. From 1957 she appeared on television, in the first German personality show, Bonsoir, Kathrin, which ran until 1964.[7] She soon starred with Peter Alexander; the two became regarded as a dream couple.[6] Her brother, the Italian musician, singer and film actor Silvio Francesco [de], performed with her, singing in many duets, dancing and playing the clarinet in the shadow of his famous sister.[9] Valente spoke six languages fluently and sang in 13.[2] Valente's single, "The Breeze and I", sold more than one million copies, per a report from 1978,[10] making it her best-selling record. It was published by the German Polydor label. At the end of 1958, this collaboration was terminated and she changed to Teldec Telefunken-Decca Schallplatten.[8]
In 1958, she filmed the musical comedy Hier bin ich – hier bleib ich (Here I Am, Here I Stay) which featured a guest appearance by Bill Haley & His Comets. During Haley's segment, Valente sang a duet with Haley on a newly recorded version of his song "Vive la Rock and Roll". She was nominated for a Grammy Award for "La strada del amore" in 1959.[11] She appeared on US television with Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald[7][5] and Dean Martin , among others.[7] She took part in the Perry Como show from 1961[7][12] to 1966, appearing eight times. She first performed on stage in Las Vegas in 1964 and had her own show on Broadway.[7]

In the mid-1960s, Valente worked with Claus Ogerman and recorded material in both Italian and English that he arranged/conducted and/or composed on the Decca[13] and London labels.[14] In 1964–65, she was a co-host (with Carol Burnett and initially Bob Newhart) of The Entertainers, a CBS variety show for which she was recognised as the best female vocalist on American television.[1] She was a frequent guest on The Dean Martin Show.[15] Valente also made three appearances on the Ed Sullivan Show. She was on US television 22 times until 1965 which earned her the Fame Award, passed by Sammy Davis Jr., as the first foreigner honoured.[1] She was in 1968 the first show star to receive the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.[7]
Over the years, she performed with many international stars, including Chet Baker,[5][16] Count Basie,[17] Johnny Carson,[2] Bing Crosby,[5] Tommy Dorsey Orchestra,[9][18] Sy Oliver,[19] Buddy Rich[9] Benny Goodman,[20]
Woody Herman,[9] Danny Kaye, Dean Martin,[2][5] Claus Ogerman,[13] and Edmundo Ros.[21] Recordings remained rare because of conflicting rights of labels.[5]
In 1970, Valente appeared in the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium singing "Before the Parade Passes By" and "The Breeze and I".[22] In Germany she performed in more than 100 television shows such as Musik ist Trumpf, also as presenter of the series Circus, Circus, and in her show Wünsche, die ich mir erfülle from 1981. A show Bravo, Catrin on the occasion of her 50th anniversary on stage in 1986 was seen by c. 17 million people.[2]
Valente withdrew from shows in the late 1980s.[7] A briglia sciolta, an Italian jazz CD recorded in 1989 and re-released in later years under the titles Fantastica and Platinum deluxe, was her best-selling CD worldwide. In 2001, she released a new album, Girltalk, with harpist Catherine Michel.[23] Valente retired in 2003.[7]
In 2019, her hit song from 1959, "Bongo cha cha cha" was included in the soundtrack of Spider-Man: Far from Home, directed by Jon Watts, becoming viral and rising to new popularity.[24][25][26][27] In 2021, the song went viral on social media platform TikTok, thanks to its use for a trend that has collected over 250 million views, started from Latin countries and South America, and then popularized also in Italy and Germany.[24][25][26][27]

Personal life[edit]
Valente was first married to the German juggler[6] Gerd Scholz[2] (aka Eric van Aro)[1] from 1951 to 1971.[5] He was also her manager. Her second husband was the pianist Roy Budd. They were divorced in 1980.[1] She had two sons.[1][6]

In retirement, she gave up her driver's license, stopped flying, and sold her villa in Beverly Hills when Trump became president. She said: "Das Alter ist nichts für Schwächlinge. Man wird langsamer. Die Umwelt wirkt chaotischer. Man hat Wehwehchen wie den grauen Star oder schlaffe Augenlider. Aber es ist faszinierend, wie man im Alter ein gutes Leben führen kann!"[1] Old age is not for the faint-hearted. You slow down. The environment seems more chaotic. You have aches and pains like cataracts or droopy eyelids. But it's fascinating how you can lead a good life in old age!
Valente died at home in Lugano on 9 September 2024, at the age of 93.[5][6][28]

Valente's recordings are listed by the Discography of American Historical Recordings.[29] She recorded 1.500 songs, chansons and Schlager, performed in 13 languages.[2]
