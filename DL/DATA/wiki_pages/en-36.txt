Artistry
Influences
Carpenter named R&B as a genre that often influences her work.[140] She cited Christina Aguilera[141][142] and Rihanna as her biggest musical influences.[143] Carpenter stated that Aguilera's 2002 song "Beautiful" helped her "showcase and develop [her] own voice",[144] citing Aguilera's vocals as an inspiration.[145] She has also named Aretha Franklin,[146] Whitney Houston and Etta James as early musical influences,[147] and cited Taylor Swift and Lorde as her songwriting influences.[148] She claimed that Swift's live performances and work ethic have inspired her.[125][123] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Carpenter said Madonna, Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, and Aguilera were some of the artists who introduced her to pop music.[149]

Musical styles
Early in her career, Carpenter was described as a "teen pop singer".[150] Later on in her career, Carpenter began to embrace pop music, with I.D. writer Barry Pierce noting that after the release of Emails I Can't Send, she "can rightfully claim the title of fully fledged popstar".[20] Variety writer Thania Garcia noted that while Carpenter was "considered a Disney princess for years, her transition from child actor to pop star [...] has been slow, steady and intentional".[151] Carpenter felt that her transition from a Disney-star was hard, with Pierce noting that she has since had more autonomy over her work.[20] Carpenter noted in an interview with Vogue that her "prior music put forth a facet of herself that she didn't feel was authentic at the time".[152] Her stage presence has also been praised with Vogue writer Chelsea Sarabia noting that "as an artist and performer, [Carpenter] wields the full range of human expression as if it were an instrument of its own".[152]
Carpenter's albums contain elements of folk pop, acoustic, country, electropop and house music.[153][154] Her albums post-Singular: Act I have delved into styles such as dance-pop, trap, hip-hop, and R&B.[155][156][157] On her sound, Carpenter noted that her music has "elements of everything".[141] In an interview with Variety in 2024, Carpenter noted that she felt separated from her albums pre-Emails I Can't Send, noting that it was "largely due to the shift in who I am as a person and as an artist, pre-pandemic and post-pandemic".[151] Alex Hopper of American Songwriter remarked storytelling as a motif of Carpenter's songs.[158] Carpenter's voice has been described as a soprano.[159][160][161][162]

Other activities
Activism and philanthropy
Throughout her career, Carpenter has actively supported charitable organizations. In 2016, Carpenter became an ambassador for the Ryan Seacrest Foundation and visited children's hospitals across the country on their behalf.[163][164] That same year, for the release of her single "Smoke and Fire", Carpenter released merchandise with proceeds going towards American Red Cross's 2Steps2Minutes campaign which brought awareness to fire safety.[165]
In 2017, Carpenter performed at the We Day California event.[166] That same year, Carpenter partnered with DoSomething's Love Letters Challenge, aimed to combat isolation for senior citizens.[167] Throughout her career, Carpenter has been an avid supporter of the LGBTQ+ community,[168][169] and in 2018, she participated in writing a love letter to the community for Billboard.[170] She noted that "When [fans] come to my shows with pride flags, screaming the lyrics at the top of [their] lungs, I hope [they] feel an overwhelming rush of love and safety."[170] In April 2020, Carpenter appeared in a charity version of "If the World Was Ending", which supported Doctors Without Borders during the COVID-19 pandemic.[171]
In June 2024, Carpenter announced she was partnering with the nonprofit PLUS1 on her Short n' Sweet Tour to create the Sabrina Carpenter Fund, dedicated to supporting the "well-being of people and animals", focusing on "mental health, animal welfare, and support for the LGBTQ+ community."[172] Later that month, it was also announced that her espresso-flavored ice cream collaboration with Van Leeuwen would have fifty percent of its profits benefit the Ali Forney Center, the largest nonprofit organization in the United States dedicated to helping homeless LGBTQ+ youth.[173]

In September 2022, Carpenter released her debut fragrance in partnership with Scent Beauty, titled Sweet Tooth.[180][181] The fragrance was nominated as a finalist by the Fragrance Foundation Awards for "Fragrance of the Year".[182] In 2023, Carpenter announced her second fragrance, Caramel Dream.[183] In July 2024, Carpenter also announced her third fragrance, Cherry Baby.[184]
